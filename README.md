# quadTree
<p>The aim of this repo is to build a basic class implementing the quadtree algorithm in different languages (C++, Python and JavaScript for now). The class should work as a blank canvas upon which one can build and implement everything needed, in this sense is not built with a specific aim in mind.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind this algorithm and how it works are well described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree), so I will not explain it further.</p>

## C++ Class

## Python Class
